# How to run
`Start.R` is a simple script that runs and manages all the models.

It's all settle! To run this script you just need to 
```
Rscript Start.R
```
and the job is done.

After the first run you can find all the data in the `.RData` files. To load the data you just need to
```
load(file = "save.image(file = "my_work_space_Start.RData")
```
You can find all the plot in here in `\Images`.
