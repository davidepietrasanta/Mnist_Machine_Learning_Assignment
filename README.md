# Mnist_Machine_Learning_Assignment

This project is the implementation of the following assigment. [Click here](https://github.com/davidepietrasanta/Mnist_Machine_Learning_Assignment/blob/main/Intro%20Lab%20Machine%20Learning.pdf) to know more.

We want to implement two of the Machine Learning models saw in class.
## Naive Bayes
The first one is the `Naive Bayes` model. 

We think that, since the images are centered and relatively simple we can say that, for example, if the center is not black the probability that the digit is a 0 (zero) should be low. Following the same logic, if the center is white the probability that that the digit is a 1 (one) should be higher than the probability that the digit is a 0 (zero).

Thinking in that way we think Naive Bayes model could work well, known that is not the optimal choice.

## Neural Network
The second one is a `Neural Network` model.

We choose this model becuase of the flexibility with different kind of problem and also their reliability with tasks involving a very large number of features.
