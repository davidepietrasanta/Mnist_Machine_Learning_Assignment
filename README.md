# Mnist_Machine_Learning_Assignment

This project is the implementation of the following assigment. [Click here](https://github.com/davidepietrasanta/Mnist_Machine_Learning_Assignment/blob/main/Intro%20Lab%20Machine%20Learning.pdf) to know more.

We want to implement two of the Machine Learning models saw in class.
## Naive Bayes
The first one is the `Naive Bayes` model. 

We think that, since the images are centered and relatively simple we can say that, for example, if the center is not black the probability that the digit is a 0 (zero) is low.

Thinking in that way we think Naive Bayes model can work well, known that they are not the optimal choice.
